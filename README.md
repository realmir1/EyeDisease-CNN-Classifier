# ⚡️ Eye Dataset Classification with TensorFlow and Keras 🚀

This project showcases the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify eye images into predefined categories. The primary focus is to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of image classification, starting from dataset preparation to training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Overview

Eye classification is an essential task in medical image analysis and computer vision. This project builds a deep learning model capable of identifying specific categories of eye images from a dataset. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model leverages CNN layers to extract features, classify images, and deliver accurate predictions.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Dataset Preparation 📊
The dataset is assumed to be organized into subfolders, each corresponding to a specific class. The project utilizes the following steps to prepare the dataset:
- **Image Resizing**: All images are resized to 200x200 pixels to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the model.
- **Data Normalization**: Pixel values are rescaled to the range [0, 1] for faster convergence during training.
- **Data Splitting**: The `ImageDataGenerator` class splits the dataset into training (90%) and validation (10%) subsets using its `validation_split` parameter.
  

### 2. Model Architecture 🏛️
The CNN model is designed using the `Sequential` API, which allows layers to be stacked in order. The architecture consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from input images using 32, 64, and 128 filters.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensions of feature maps, minimizing computational cost and retaining critical information.
- **Dropout Layer**: Introduced after dense layers to reduce overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers are added for classification. The final layer uses the `softmax` activation function to output class probabilities for the 4 categories.
  
### 3. Model Compilation ✅
The model is compiled with the following configurations:
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`, known for its efficient and adaptive learning rate.
- **Loss Function**: `categorical_crossentropy`, suitable for multi-class classification problems.
- **Metric**: `accuracy`, used to monitor the model's performance during training and validation.
  
### 4. Model Training 🏃🏽
The model is trained using the prepared training dataset for 10 epochs. During training:
- The model learns to recognize patterns in images using the convolutional layers.
- Validation data is used to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
  
### 5. Evaluation and Visualization 👁️
The model's performance is evaluated using several methods:
- **Accuracy and Loss Graphs**: Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's learning curve.
- **Predictions**: Sample predictions are generated using the test dataset, displaying the true labels alongside the predicted labels.
